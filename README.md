有生之年硬件篇之系列二：“掌”控万物    
I designed a glove with five flex sensors on each finger using Arduino.   
The flex sensor measures the amount of deflection or bending. When it is flexed, it's resistance would be changed and could serve as an indicator.
Then I built three games or say, interation parts with Processing.    
- Piano     
- Finger guessing     
- Dont touch white tiles      

As for an independent device, it was powered by a 5-V battery, and communicated with the host computer with Bluetooth.
